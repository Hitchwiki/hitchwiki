# This playbook is used to gather status updates from all guests in logs/status/{{ansible_host}} (see below)
#  - First scripts/status.sh is triggered remotely which writes to log/state.yml.
#  - Then a report with passed chapters and started services is shown for each host.
# When code/paths changed lately the update playbook should be run first to issue `git pull`.
