# https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#configuration-file
#
# By default no cli.ini file is created, after creating one it is possible to specify
# the location of this configuration file with certbot-auto --config cli.ini.
#
# By default, the following locations are searched:
#   /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/letsencrypt/cli.ini
#   (or ~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).
#
# Run Certbot with "--help" to learn more about the available options.
#
# Note that these options apply automatically to all use of Certbot for
# obtaining or renewing certificates, so options specific to a single
# certificate on a system with several certificates should not be placed
# here.

# Use a 4096 bit RSA key instead of 2048
rsa-key-size = 4096

# Uncomment and update to register with the specified e-mail address
email = {{ admin_contact }}

# Uncomment to use the webroot authenticator. Replace webroot-path with the
# path to the public_html / webroot folder being served by your web server.
authenticator = webroot
webroot-path = {{ dir.root }}
